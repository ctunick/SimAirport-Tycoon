# Development Guidelines for Airport Tycoon

This document defines how we use **Cursor** (and other LLM-powered tools) to build and maintain the Airport Tycoon project, following **game design and engineering best practices**.

The goal is:
- Consistent architecture and style across contributors  
- Safe, reviewable AI-assisted changes  
- A focus on *fun, clarity, and extensibility* over cleverness

## 1. Goals & Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Game Design Principles

When working on this project (with or without Cursor), keep these in mind:

- **Protect the core loop**  
  The core loop is: *build → simulate → passengers flow → earn → unlock*.  
  Any changes should either:
  - Clarify or deepen this loop, or  
  - Make it easier to tune, visualize, or extend.

- **Vertical slice first**  
  We prefer a small polished slice over a wide shallow feature set.  
  Aim to:
  - Make one flow feel good (e.g., entrance → gate → board)  
  - THEN generalize it (add more zones, needs, unlocks)

- **Data-driven, not hard-coded**  
  - Gameplay parameters (costs, rewards, unlock thresholds, schedules) should live in **ScriptableObjects** or JSON generated by Python.
  - AI and game rules should be *parameterized* where possible.

- **Component-based design**  
  - Use Unity’s strengths: small, focused `MonoBehaviour` components.
  - Avoid “god classes” and giant manager objects that know everything.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.

- **Future-proof for co-op**  
  - All player actions (build, delete, interact) should flow through a **command system**.
  - Keep simulation logic deterministic-ish and serializable where feasible.
