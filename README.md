# SimAirport-Tycoon

# SimAirport Tycoon (Working Title)

An open-source airport management & tycoon game built with **Unity** and **Python**, designed from day one to be:

* **Moddable**
* **LLM-friendly** (Cursor / Claude / etc.)
* **Co-op ready in the long term**
* Eventually **multi-platform** (PC first, then mobile platforms such as iOS)

If you love classic Tycoon games, simulation sandboxes, or just want to help build a community-driven airport sim, you’re in the right place. ✈️

> **Project status:** Pre-alpha / v0.0.1 – Expect rough edges and placeholder art while we build out the core loop.

## Vision

SimAirport Tycoon aims to capture the joy of designing and optimizing a living airport:

* Place terminals, check-in, security, gates, and services on a grid.
* Watch AI passengers flow through your designs.
* Balance costs and revenue.
* Unlock new buildings and mechanics as your airport grows.

Longer-term, the vision includes:

* **Co-op / multiplayer support (post-1.0)**
  Multiple players collaboratively designing and managing a shared airport via a command-based simulation core.

  > Co-op is a **long-term goal** and will **not** be attempted before at least version **1.0.0**, after the single-player experience is stable and feature-complete.

* **Additional platforms**

  * PC (primary target for development)
  * Eventually **iOS** and other platforms, once the core simulation is stable and performant.

* **Deep simulation & modding**
  Data-driven configs, Python tools for generating schedules and balancing, and a clean architecture that invites experimentation.

---

## Current Scope (v0.0.1)

The initial vertical slice focuses on:

* **Basic world building**

  * Grid-based placement of core facilities (entrance, check-in, security, gates, restrooms).
* **Simple AI passengers**

  * Agents that move through the airport: entrance → check-in → security → gate → board.
* **Economy**

  * Earn money for each passenger successfully boarded.
  * Spend money to build new structures.
* **Progression / Unlocks**

  * New buildables and systems unlock as you meet simple milestones (e.g., passengers served).
* **Python-driven data**

  * Flight schedules and simple configs generated by Python scripts, exported as JSON for Unity.

Everything is intentionally small and focused so we can polish the **build → simulate → earn → unlock** loop before layering on complexity.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Engine:** Unity (LTS 3D / URP), C#
* **Tooling:** Python for data generation and balancing
* **Editor Assistance:** Cursor / Claude / other LLMs guided by project prompts
* **Platforms:**

  * Current: PC (Windows)
  * Future: other desktop platforms + iOS (and possibly more)

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

You’ll need:

* **Git**
* **Unity (LTS 3D / URP)**

  * Install via Unity Hub.
* **Python 3.x**

  * Recommended: 3.10+ for tooling.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/simairport-tycoon.git
cd simairport-tycoon
```

### 3. Generate Data (Optional for early builds)

From the `python/` directory:

```bash
cd python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present

python tools/export_to_json.py   # generates basic flight schedules & configs
```

This will create JSON config files under:

```text
unity/AirportTycoonUnity/Assets/Data/
```

### 4. Open in Unity

1. Open **Unity Hub**.
2. Click **Open** and select `unity/AirportTycoonUnity/`.
3. Open the `DemoScene` (usually under `Assets/Scenes/`).
4. Press **Play** to run the current vertical slice.

You should see:

* A simple airport layout.
* AI passengers moving through core zones.
* Money changing as passengers successfully board.

## Development Workflow

We embrace LLM-assisted development, but with guardrails.

* **Development standards & architecture:**
  See [`docs/Development-Guidelines.md`](docs/Development-Guidelines.md)
  This covers:

  * How to use Cursor/Claude safely.
  * Coding standards for Unity (C#) and Python.
  * Game design principles for any new feature.

* **Meta prompts for LLMs:**
  See [`docs/MetaPrompt.md`](docs/MetaPrompt.md)
  This file contains:

  * Canonical prompts for scaffolding systems (e.g., AI agents, grid logic, economy).
  * How to ask LLMs for small, reviewable diffs instead of giant refactors.

> **Important:** Treat LLM output as a suggestion, not an authority. Always review diffs, playtest changes, and keep the game’s core loop fun and understandable.

## Contributing

We **welcome open source contributors** and **Tycoon fans of all experience levels**:

* Game designers
* Programmers (C# / Python)
* Artists (2D/3D/UI)
* Sound designers & composers
* Writers and UX folks

### How to Get Involved

1. Read [`docs/Development-Guidelines.md`](docs/Development-Guidelines.md) to understand:

   * Coding style
   * Architectural patterns
   * How we use Cursor/LLMs in this repo
2. Check [`docs/MetaPrompt.md`](docs/MetaPrompt.md) if you plan to use LLMs for implementation.
3. Look at open issues on GitHub:

   * Good first tasks will be labeled (e.g., `good first issue`, `help wanted`).
4. Open a draft PR early if you’re unsure about direction.
5. Be kind and constructive in discussions—this is a collaborative, community-driven project.

## Roadmap (High-Level)

The roadmap will evolve with community input, but some broad milestones:

* **v0.0.x – Core Loop & Stability**

  * Solid single-player loop: build → simulate → earn → unlock.
  * Clean AI pathing & basic passenger behaviors.
  * Configurable economy & schedules.

* **v0.1.x – Depth & Variety**

  * More zones (baggage, food courts, shops, lounges).
  * Passenger needs (hunger, comfort, stress, etc.).
  * Better visual feedback & UI polish.

* **v0.2.x – Systems & Polish**

  * Improved UX and building tools.
  * Better visualization, performance tuning, and accessibility features.
  * Expanded modding hooks and data-driven systems.

* **v1.0.0 – Feature-Complete Single Player**

  * Robust, replayable single-player simulation.
  * Well-documented modding and data pipelines.
  * Stable base suitable for long-term saves and balance work.

* **v1.0.0+ – Co-op Foundations & Platform Expansion**

  * Command-based simulation exposed over a network.
  * Multiple players building/controlling the same airport.
  * Performance tuning & input adjustments for **iOS** and potentially other platforms.

> Co-op is explicitly out of scope for all pre-1.0 releases. Early versions will focus entirely on making single-player tight, stable, and fun.

Roadmap details (and what’s currently being worked on) will live in GitHub issues and project boards.
